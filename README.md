## Overview

This repository contains a **microcontroller-based minimum system PCB** designed as a centralized control unit for embedded and control-oriented applications. The board integrates a microcontroller with multiple output interfaces, allowing it to function as the main controller for external drivers, actuators, and expansion modules.

The design emphasizes **functional clarity, modularity, and ease of development**, making it suitable both as a development platform and as a control core for real-world implementations. With a structured layout and clear signal separation, the PCB supports reliable operation and future system expansion.

## Functional Description

The PCB serves as the **core processing and control unit** of an embedded system. The integrated microcontroller executes control logic, processes input signals, and manages multiple output channels. These outputs can be used to interface with external motor drivers, control modules, or other peripheral systems.

By combining control logic and output management on a single board, this minimum system simplifies system architecture and reduces the need for additional interface circuitry. The design is intended to be flexible, allowing developers to adapt it to various applications without significant redesign.
